        <h2>Description</h2>
        If you’re looking for an introduction to deviled eggs, this is the place to start: just eggs, mustard, mayonnaise, a dash of Tabasco and a festive sprinkle of paprika (or jazz things up with a garnish of chives). They are a simple and spectacular addition to a holiday table.
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>6 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>1 to 2 dashes Tabasco sauce, to taste</li>
            <li>Salt, to taste</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon snipped fresh chives</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons mayonnaise</li>
            <li>Paprika, for garnish</li>
            <li>Whole fresh chives, for garnish</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse eggs with warm water, and place in a small saucepan. Cover with cold water, place the pan over medium-high heat and bring to a boil. Turn off heat, cover and let sit for 10-12 minutes. Drain, rinse under cold water or transfer to a bowl of ice and water, then peel. Cool in the refrigerator, loosely covered, for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Halve eggs lengthwise, and carefully remove yolks. Place yolks in a bowl, and mash with a fork. Stir in mustard, Tabasco, salt, pepper, snipped chives and mayonnaise.</li>
            <li>Fill each egg white with about 1½ teaspoons of the egg-yolk mixture using a spoon or piping bag fitted with a star tip and dust the top with paprika. Arrange on a platter; garnish with whole chives.</li>
        </ol>
