    <h2>Description</h2>
    Jalapeño poppers are the perfect easy party food! Cheesy and spicy in every crunchy bite, they're a great tailgate food idea, appetizer, finger food, or anytime snack. Don't be scared if you don't love spicy jalapeño recipes; these can be mild or spicy, depending on your preference. The cheesy filling of this recipe is inspired by Ree Drummond's pimento cheese—it's the perfect blend of creamy, spicy, and is supremely snackable! Plus, it can even stirred together ahead of time to make assembling even easier come party time. The crispy bacon on top is the ultimate finishing touch!
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
           <li>12 fresh jalapeño peppers</li>
           <li>2 c. shredded sharp cheddar cheese</li>
           <li>4 oz. cream cheese, softened</li>
           <li>2 tbsp. mayonnaise</li>
           <li>1/4 c. diced pimiento peppers, drained</li>
           <li>1/4 c. minced white or yellow onion</li>
           <li>1/2 tsp. kosher salt, divided</li>
           <li>1/2 tsp. smoked paprika, divided</li>
           <li>1/2 tsp. ground black pepper, divided</li>
           <li>1/2 c. panko breadcrumbs</li>
           <li>2 tsp. olive oil</li>
           <li>6 slices bacon, cooked and crumbled</li>
           <li>Chopped fresh chives, for garnish</li> 
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oven to 375 degrees. Grease an 8-inch cast iron skillet or 1-quart baking dish with butter.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine the cream cheese, mayonnaise, shallot, chives, garlic, lemon juice, Cajun seasoning, mustard powder, Worcestershire sauce and ⅓ cup Parmesan. Stir until well combined. Add the crabmeat and gently stir until just combined, trying to not break up the large lumps. Season with pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>Scrape into the prepared skillet and smooth the top. Sprinkle the ground butter crackers and remaining 2 tablespoons Parmesan on top.</li>
            <li>Bake until golden brown and bubbling, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes, then sprinkle with ground cayenne, hot sauce and chives. Serve with baguette, celery sticks, carrots, additional crackers and more hot sauce.</li>
