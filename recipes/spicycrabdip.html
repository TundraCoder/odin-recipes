        <h2>Description</h2>
        This festive appetizer is sure to please.  Also known as Maryland crab dip because of its Chesapeake Bay, it's served hot out of the oven and is extra creamy thanks to the combination of cream cheese and a little mayonnaise.  Canned lump crabmeat makes this dish simple to assemble. Just be careful to leave the clumps of meat as intact as possible when mixing. A sprinkle of cayenne pepper and a generous douse of hot sauce add heat to this flavorful dish.
